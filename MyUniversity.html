<h3> About my University: </h3>

<p>
I transferred to Rutgers University-Newark in the Spring '25 semester as a commuter student, after completing my A.S. in CS at HCCC. For my Fall semester courses, I registered for my regular CS courses and the course "Sociology/Anthropology of Science and Technology", which led me to rethink my potential options of my minor. Over the summer, alongside 2 CS courses, I took 2 more anthropology electives, which solidified my decision. Now, I'm taking four Computer Science courses and one cultural anthropology course! For my Spring 26' semester, I'm looking forward to completing my major + minor, as well as a Data Science elective (Ethics of Data). 
Throughout undergrad, I have been interested in combining different fields with my Computer Science major, leading me to take classes in philosophy, community justice studies, WGSS, and now anthropology. I admire students who carve out other unconventional degree combinations as well!

</p>

<h3> About my other commitments: </h3>
<p> I sought out to join different organizations at every school I've studied in, to continue work in the issues I care about and the movements I value. I was a part of some identity based organizations-- groups like Allegheny's Latinas on the Rise-- and action-based organizations, such as Food Recovery Network, and NJPIRG's Hunger & Homelessness campgain here at Rutgers-Newark.
Both at HCCC and here at Rutgers, I've served as Vice President of the Girls Who Code college chapters.
 I am proud and grateful for our largest milestone yet-- GWCs's and ColorStack's large-scale 'HackFest', where 150+ students from different colleges and univiseritites competed, created innovative projects, and connected with passionate sponsors and recruiters. I have also started collaborating with my peer, Richell, in exploring undergraduate research-- continuing the work to develop an AI algorithm that can detect false positives and negatives more accurately.

<h4> Food Recovery Network </h4>

<p>I prioritize community-oriented activities and commitments-- I try to find ways to either give back whether I'm leading the activity or joining a larger group. I care about addressing issues like food insecurity, which I helped address on my previous college's campus by joining their efforts in their Food Recovery Network chapter and in NJPIRG. 
    I also enjoy giving back through helping skill building with others, like a series of Python workshops my GWC board organized at HCCC.

<h3> Future Endeavors </h3>
<p> As I finish the final chapter of my undergraduate career, I continue to explore opportunities to work with community members, and I may explore a path within Data Science alongside my Anthropology minor. Though I am not set on one particular career field, I will continue to explore opportunities where I can collaborate with organizations and companies who hold similar values as mine: innovation and inclusion for all.  </p>
