<h3> About my background: </h3>

<p>Though I've explored different academic paths in different places, I've been curious about studying CS since about 3rd grade; I learned what coding meant through an elementary code block game, and the creative possibility of it stuck with me since. 
I've lived in New Jersey my whole life, but I've spent time staying in Massachussets for high school, and at a liberal arts college in Pennsylvania for the beginning of undergrad.
I'm half Ecuadorian, and have traveled to visit familiy multiple  times since I was young! I flew on my own for the first time when I was 12, and I stayed for 3 months. Spending time with my (larger) extended family and exploring the gorgeous landscapes (from mountain ranges to mineral hot springs in the tropics) makes every visit incredibly memorable.
More often though, I am traveling along the east coast (mainly Pennsylvania, Maryland, and New York) to spend time with my friends and family.

<h3> About my interests: </h3>
I've always been interested in varying creative outlets and have been lucky to explore them over the years. My favorites throughout recent years have been ice skating, yoga, pottery, and I have a love-hate relationship with rowing after being on a team for a semester. Fundamentally, I will always love playing instruments (mainly piano) and singing, as I started with my school's chorus and (jazz) band (playing bass clarinet) in early years. 

<h3> Extra Tidbits: </h3>
<p>  
     I have gotten to see some of my favorite artists in concert, one of them because of a free music festival in Brooklyn! Most of the concerts have either been R&B artists, varying alternative artists, and the most memorable has been Deftones. 
   In terms of literature + media, I have a massive growing list of movies and books I'd like to read and watch one day. I've grown up cutting down the list in spurts (ie. listening to a list of artists' discographies a for a summer, watching a movie a day for a month).
